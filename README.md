# PAY MY BILLS

Pay My Bills is a web app that helps you to, you guessed it, pay your bills !

Do you have problems keeping up with all the bills you have to pay ? no ? just me ?

well, I built this web app for myself, but you can use it if you like !

here is the node API: <a href="https://github.com/akiosTerr/pay-my-bills-api">pay-my-bills-api</a>


It is actually very simple, you register a new bill with the name, the next due date and Url to access the website of the bill if you like
the bill item will keep up with the expiration day and warn you by status colors
once you click to pay the bill (after typing the value) it will reset for the next month and register the payment on the history component


the first the functional protype is ready, but there is a TON of things to improve
small things like a edit bill function and big things like a line chart component
