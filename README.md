<h3>
PMB is a financial management UI tool
</h3>

It is actually very simple:   
You register a new bill with the name and the next expiration date,  
The bill item will keep up with the expiration day and warn you by status colors:
  - **green**: just paid
  - **blue**: far from expiration
  - **yellow**: close from expiration
  - **red**: late

once you click the "pay bill" button (after typing the value)  
It will reset for next month, and the payment will be registered in the Payment History section.  
Remember, the app only lets you click the "pay bill" button on the yellow or red status.
