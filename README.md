### Pay My Bills is a basic recurring expenses management web app  
It is actually very simple:   
you register a new bill with the name, the next expiration date and a (optional) url to access the website of the bill,  
the bill item will keep up with the expiration day and warn you by status colors:
  - **green**: just paid
  - **blue**: far from expiration
  - **yellow**: close from expiration
  - **red**: late

once you click the "pay bill" button (after typing the value)  
it will reset for the next month and register the payment on the Payment History section.  
Remember, the app only lets you click the "pay bill" button on the yellow or red status.
